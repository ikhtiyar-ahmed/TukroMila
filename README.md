TukroMila (টুকরোমিলা) 
TukroMila is a specialized, interactive web-based application designed for Bengali speakers to master Chinese sentence structures. 
By combining the logic of "Tukro" (Blocks) and "Mila" (Match), this app transforms textbook learning into an engaging, gamified experience.

Creative Edge: Why use this over Duolingo?

Contextual Relevance: Duolingo teaches general phrases. TukroMila teaches you the exact words you need for your class exams and textbook chapters.
Zero Data Privacy Concerns: No logins, no tracking, no data selling. Your progress stays on your device.
Bengali-First Logic: Most global apps translate Chinese to English. TukroMila understands the nuances of how a Bengali speaker thinks and translates.
